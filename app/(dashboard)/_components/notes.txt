IconType Union: By defining a union type (IconType) for the possible icons, you make it clear to TypeScript what strings are valid.
iconMap: The iconMap object is typed to ensure that only valid IconType keys are used, which points to the correct icon components.
Strong Typing: The SidebarItem component now expects an IconType, ensuring that only the valid icon identifiers are passed, eliminating the TypeScript errors.
Above is the solution for the error :-

Warning: Only plain objects can be passed to Client Components from Server Components. Classes or other objects with methods are not supported.
  <... icon={{$$typeof: ..., render: ...}} label=... href=...>

 тип Error: Functions cannot be passed directly to Client Components unless you explicitly expose it by marking it with "use server". Or maybe you meant to

What did we learn from this error :-

From fixing this error, we can draw several important lessons related to TypeScript, React, and component design:

 1. Type Safety
   - Strong Typing with TypeScript: TypeScript enforces strict type checking, which helps catch errors at compile time rather than runtime. By defining a union type (`IconType`), we ensure that only valid values are passed to the `icon` prop. This makes our code safer and less prone to bugs.
   - Component Props Validation: We learned the importance of validating the types of props passed to components. By explicitly defining the types, we avoid potential issues where unexpected values could be passed.

 2. Mapping Identifiers to Components
   - Using Object Maps: The `iconMap` is an example of mapping string identifiers to actual React components. This approach is useful when you need to dynamically render components based on some identifier. However, TypeScript requires that these mappings are strongly typed to avoid errors.
   - Discriminated Unions: By using a discriminated union type for `IconType`, we ensure that only a specific set of values can be used, making the code more predictable and easier to refactor.

 3. Handling Client and Server Components
   - Client vs. Server Components: React's new architecture differentiates between client and server components. The error we encountered ("Functions cannot be passed directly to Client Components...") reminds us that we need to be mindful of how data and functions are passed between these two types of components. Specifically, client components should not directly receive functions or complex objects from server components unless they're properly serialized or exposed.

 4. Best Practices in Component Design
   - Separation of Concerns: We saw the importance of separating concerns between components (`SidebarRoutes` and `SidebarItem`). Each component should handle a specific part of the logic, making the code easier to maintain and understand.
   - Explicitness in Code: Being explicit in how components are designed and how props are passed makes the code more maintainable and easier for others to understand. It also helps avoid common pitfalls like the errors we encountered.

 5. Learning from Errors
   - Error Messages as Guidance: Error messages, especially in TypeScript, provide valuable guidance on what's wrong and often point directly to the solution. In this case, TypeScript's feedback helped us understand the limitations of passing certain types of props to components.

 Summary
This exercise highlights the importance of type safety, understanding React's architecture, and adhering to best practices in component design. By leveraging TypeScript's features, we can write more robust, maintainable, and error-resistant code.
